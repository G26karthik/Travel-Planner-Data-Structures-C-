# Travel Planner Using Graphs

## Overview

This project is a **Travel Planner** developed in **C**, designed to assist users in planning travel routes between cities. It leverages data structures such as **Graphs**, **Adjacency Matrices**, and **Trees** to model and compute optimal paths.

## Features

- **Graph Representation**: Models cities and routes using graphs and adjacency matrices.
- **Optimal Path Calculation**: Implements algorithms to find the most efficient travel routes.
- **Sample Output**: Provides example outputs to demonstrate functionality.

## Prerequisites

- **C Compiler**: Ensure a C compiler (like GCC) is installed.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/G26karthik/Travel-Planner-Using-Graphs.git
   cd Travel-Planner-Data-Structures-C-
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Code Directory**:

   ```sh
   cd 'Travel Planner Code'
   ```

## Project Structure

- `Travel Planner Code/`: Contains the main source code files.
- `Sample Output/`: Includes example outputs to illustrate program functionality.
- `input.txt`: Provides sample input data for testing.

## How to Run

1. **Compile the Code**:

   ```sh
   gcc -o travel_planner main.c
   ```

2. **Execute the Program**:

   ```sh
   ./travel_planner
   ```

   Alternatively, open the project in your preferred **IDE** (such as Code::Blocks or CLion) and run the `main.c` file.

## Usage

- **Input Data**: Modify `input.txt` to include your specific cities and routes.
- **Run Program**: Execute the compiled program to see the optimal travel plan based on the input data.
